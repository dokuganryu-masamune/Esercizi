In the planning direction phase the overall focus is on the organization of the team members of the SOC.

Any member must exactly know what he has to do and why. These aspects are important because when is needed the team must accomplish a more singular task that can be monitor a particular threat and understand a particular technology and of course find vulnerabilities in that particular organization.

At some point the team must understand globally any single aspect about the scope of the environment and because of that the team is asked to direct the operational activities on less options from the whole big picture.

This kind of strategy gives the CTI team a quicker capability to respond their needs to protect the organization from threats  and because of that even if the threat landscape is growing the surface of the attacker becomes littler littler until it can disappear in front of the enormous moving target that the enemy will faceoff when is going to find one.

In these phase we are going to plan defensive contromeasures for internal cybersecurity activities and external cybersecurity activitities; for the internal we are going to plan what is possible to harden and what is possible to do to deviate an attack when it's coming and it potentially could hit the core of the organization; for the external the CTI team is going to evaluate the threat lanscape in search of informations that have much more meaning for the organization's safeguard and preventing those kind of scenario that the organization is more at risk to be posed.
